## Launching model training

We use [Weights and Biases](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart) for tracking the experiments. Follow the quickstart instructions on how to [set up wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart#1.-set-up-wandb). You only need to follow the instructions in section 1.

Once Weights and Biases is set up, you can begin training a model with: 

```
./scripts/train.sh
```

You can monitor the training at https://wandb.ai by logging into your account.
